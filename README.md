ASCII Video Renderer

This Python script utilizes OpenCV and Tkinter libraries to capture video frames from a camera and render them as ASCII art in a Tkinter window. The ASCII art conversion is performed by mapping grayscale pixel intensities to a set of ASCII characters, creating a video-like display of the camera feed in the terminal.
Features:

    Real-time video capture from a webcam.
    Conversion of video frames to grayscale.
    Generation of ASCII art representation for each frame.
    Display of ASCII video in a resizable Tkinter window.

Requirements:

    Python 3.x
    OpenCV (cv2)
    NumPy
    Tkinter
    Pillow (PIL)

Usage:

    Ensure the required libraries are installed (pip install opencv-python numpy pillow).
    Run the script to start capturing and rendering the ASCII video.
    Resize the Tkinter window to adjust the ASCII video display.

Feel free to customize the ASCII character set (chars) and font size in the Tkinter label for different visual effects.
