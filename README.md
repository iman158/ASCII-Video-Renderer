# ASCII-Video-Renderer
This Python script utilizes OpenCV and Tkinter libraries to capture video frames from a camera and render them as ASCII art in a Tkinter window. The ASCII art conversion is performed by mapping grayscale pixel intensities to a set of ASCII characters, creating a video-like display of the camera feed in the terminal.
